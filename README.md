# Roll For ðŸ¥”

[Original Repository](https://github.com/drraccoony/RollForPotatoJS)

This is a web-based timer.

## Reference

A friend wanted a "Hot Potato" timer while playing Elden Ring with doing invasions. But an application didn't exist for their needs. So I desired to step in and help.

The project is being hosted on Github-Pages to [preview the application](https://github.com/drraccoony/RollForPotatoJS/deployments/activity_log?environment=github-pages).

## Modifications

Most of the lines at the top of `scripts\hotPotato.js` can be modified to change different aspects of the application.
